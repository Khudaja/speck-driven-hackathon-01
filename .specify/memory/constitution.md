# Unified Book + RAG Chatbot Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Kit Plus + Claude Code Development
All development follows Spec-Kit Plus methodology with Claude Code assistance. The Docusaurus-based book content and RAG chatbot must be developed using structured specifications and AI-assisted coding practices. This ensures consistent, well-documented, and maintainable code throughout the project lifecycle.

### II. Accurate, Modular Content Architecture
The book content must be modular, accurate, and deployable on GitHub Pages. Each chapter and section should be independently accessible and maintainable. Content organization follows logical grouping with clear navigation, enabling easy updates and maintenance while ensuring the RAG chatbot can accurately reference specific sections.

### III. RAG-Only Response Constraint (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The chatbot MUST answer ONLY from book text content. No external data sources, hallucinations, or external API calls are permitted for responses. The RAG system must strictly retrieve and reference only the provided book content, ensuring accuracy and reliability of all responses generated by the chatbot.

### IV. Specified Tech Stack Adherence
Implementation must use the specified technology stack: FastAPI, Neon Postgres, Qdrant, and OpenAI Agents/ChatKit. No alternative technologies may be substituted without explicit architectural review and approval. This ensures compatibility, maintainability, and adherence to the established architecture.

### V. Performance and Latency Requirements
The system must deliver fast responses (<2s response time) and maintain high availability. All components must be optimized for performance, with specific attention to database queries, vector search operations, and API response times. Performance benchmarks must be established and maintained throughout development.

### VI. Clean, Documented Code Standards
All code must be clean, well-documented, and follow best practices. Documentation includes inline comments, API documentation, setup guides, and usage instructions. Code must be readable, maintainable, and follow established patterns within the chosen technology stack.

## Technology Stack Requirements

The project must strictly adhere to the following technology stack:
- Frontend: Docusaurus for book content, React components for chatbot integration
- Backend: FastAPI for API services
- Database: Neon Postgres for relational data
- Vector Database: Qdrant for RAG operations
- AI Services: OpenAI Agents/ChatKit for chatbot functionality
- Deployment: GitHub Pages for frontend, serverless backend for API services
- Development: Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus for development assistance

## Development Workflow

The development process follows these requirements:
- All features must be specified before implementation using Spec-Kit Plus templates
- Code reviews must verify compliance with all constitution principles
- Testing must include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end validation
- Performance benchmarks must pass before merging
- Documentation updates must accompany all code changes
- Setup and usage documentation must be comprehensive and up-to-date

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and must be followed without exception. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with each principle. Any deviation from these principles requires explicit architectural review and constitutional amendment. The project team must regularly review compliance with these principles and ensure all development activities align with the stated goals.
