# Research: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Decision: Visualization tools for digital twin concepts
**Rationale**: Based on educational best practices for technical content, a mixed approach of diagrams, 3D models, and videos provides the most comprehensive learning experience for complex topics like digital twins.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Diagrams and flowcharts alone (too limited for 3D concepts)
- Interactive 3D models only (may be too complex for beginners)
- Video tutorials only (not interactive enough)

## Decision: Prerequisite knowledge approach
**Rationale**: A mixed approach that provides different pathways based on student experience levels makes the content accessible to a wider audience while still providing value to more experienced students.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Beginner level only (might be too slow for experienced students)
- Intermediate level only (would exclude beginners)
- Basic understanding only (compromise but still excludes some groups)

## Technology Research: Gazebo Integration
**Best practices for Gazebo in educational contexts**:
- Use simple, clear examples that demonstrate core concepts
- Provide downloadable sample models for hands-on practice
- Include troubleshooting sections for common issues
- Link to official Gazebo documentation for deeper learning

## Technology Research: Unity Integration
**Best practices for Unity in educational contexts**:
- Focus on core features relevant to robotics simulation
- Provide step-by-step tutorials with visual aids
- Include project templates for quick start
- Reference Unity Learn resources for additional learning

## Technology Research: Sensor Simulation Concepts
**Best practices for teaching sensor simulation**:
- Start with conceptual understanding before implementation
- Use real-world analogies to explain sensor behavior
- Provide comparison charts showing different sensor types
- Include practical exercises with measurable outcomes
