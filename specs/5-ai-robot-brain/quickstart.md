# Quickstart: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) Module

## Getting Started

This quickstart guide will help you begin working with the AI-Robot Brain module covering NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 for humanoid robot path planning.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with ROS 2 (covered in previous module)
- Access to the educational content through the Docusaurus-based book
- Computer capable of running Isaac Sim (recommended: NVIDIA GPU for accelerated simulation)

## Module Overview

The AI-Robot Brain module consists of 3 chapters:

1. **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: Learn about photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
2. **Isaac ROS**: Understand accelerated perception and VSLAM for humanoid robots
3. **Nav2 Path Planning**: Master navigation systems for humanoid robot mobility

## Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim

1. Navigate to "Modules" → "AI-Robot Brain" → "Chapter 1: Isaac Sim"
2. Review the learning objectives and prerequisites
3. Follow the step-by-step tutorials on:
   - Setting up Isaac Sim environments
   - Creating synthetic data for robot training
   - Configuring photorealistic rendering
4. Complete the practical exercises and assessments

## Chapter 2: Isaac ROS for Perception

1. Navigate to "Modules" → "AI-Robot Brain" → "Chapter 2: Isaac ROS VSLAM"
2. Review the learning objectives and prerequisites
3. Follow the step-by-step tutorials on:
   - Setting up Isaac ROS perception pipelines
   - Implementing Visual SLAM algorithms
   - Processing sensor data in real-time
4. Complete the practical exercises and assessments

## Chapter 3: Nav2 for Humanoid Path Planning

1. Navigate to "Modules" → "AI-Robot Brain" → "Chapter 3: Nav2 Path Planning"
2. Review the learning objectives and prerequisites
3. Follow the step-by-step tutorials on:
   - Configuring Nav2 for humanoid constraints
   - Setting up global and local planners
   - Implementing obstacle avoidance strategies
4. Complete the practical exercises and assessments

## Best Practices
