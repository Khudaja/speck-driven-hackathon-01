## 🧠 Technologies Used

### 🔹 Speckit
**Speckit** was used to design and manage the textbook content in a **modular and specification-driven format**.  
It enables structured authoring of educational material by organizing content into clear modules and chapters, ensuring consistency and scalability.  
Speckit also supports systematic documentation workflows, making it suitable for large technical textbooks and instructional material.

### 🔹 Docusaurus
**Docusaurus** is used as the documentation framework to present the textbook in a **clean, navigable, and web-friendly format**.  
It provides:
- Static site generation for fast performance
- Versioned and modular documentation support
- Markdown-based content management
- Easy deployment on platforms like Vercel

Docusaurus allows the textbook to be accessed as an interactive documentation-style website, improving readability and learning experience.
